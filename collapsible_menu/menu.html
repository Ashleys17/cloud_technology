                The trunk or probosis of the elephant is one of the most versatile organs to have evolve among mammals.The trunk is a combination of the upper lip and nose; the nostrils are located at the tip. 
                It is large and powerful, weighing about 130 kg (290 pounds) in an adult male and capable of lifting a load of about 250 kg. 
                However, it is also extremely dexterous, mobile, and sensitive, which makes it appear almost independent of the rest of the animal. Elephants use the trunk like a hand in other ways as well.
                This includes holding branches and scratching themselves in places that the trunk and tail cannot reach.  In the African elephant both the male and the female possess tusks,
                 whereas in the Asian elephant it is mainly the male that has tusks. When present in the female, tusks are small, thin, and often of a uniform thickness. Some male Asian elephants are tuskless and are known as muknas.
                 Common health problems for elephants in zoos include herpes, tuberculosis, arthritis, and obesity. The effect of captivity on this highly intelligent, social and wide-ranging species also likely has psychological effects, 
                 as sometimes evidenced by unusual aggressiveness or repetitive behaviors.One of the most moving displays of elephant emotion is the grieving process. Elephants remember and mourn loved ones, even many years after their death. 
                 When an elephant walks past a place that a loved one died at, he or she will stop and take a silent pause that can last several minutes.
